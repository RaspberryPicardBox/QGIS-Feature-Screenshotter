# QGIS Feature Screenshotter
This plugin is designed to enable taking screenshots of a large number of individual assets against a base map in QGIS.

This plugin is could potentially be useful for many applications, including creating datasets for geospatial analysis in ML, or simply creating on-the-fly screenshots for making pretty maps.
